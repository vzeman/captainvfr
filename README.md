# Captain VFR

Mobile application for VFR pilots to plan their flights, check the weather, and get notified about TFRs.

## Features
- Flight planning
- Weather information (Translation of TAF and METAR to human-readable format)
- Airport information
- TFR notifications
- Flight tracking


## Installation
I will try to push the app to the App Store and Google Play Store, but for now you can build it from source.
### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- Xcode (for iOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Git


## Proof of AI
All code in this repository was written by AI, most os the time I have use SWE model from Windsurf and later Cloude Sonnet 4 from Github Copilot.
This is a proof of concept, I will try to improve the code quality and add more features in the future.
It is also a proof, that anyone can build application of this complexity with AI assistance.
