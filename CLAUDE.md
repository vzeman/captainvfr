## Workflow Guidelines
- Always use plan.md file to understand tasks and plan execution
- ALWAYS check if code has no ERRORS, WARNINGS or RECOMMENDATIONS during building to keep the code clean and without issues 
- ALWAYS REFACTOR classes and methods to keep the code clean and readable without duplicated code, split too long classes (more than 800 lines) into smaller classes 
- ALWAYS keep the code clean without test or helper files you create during development, remove them after you finish the task
