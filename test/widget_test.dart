// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';


void main() {
  testWidgets('App launches successfully', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    // Note: CaptainVFRApp requires providers and services to be initialized,
    // so this is just a basic test that the import is correct.
    // For full widget testing, you would need to wrap the app with
    // proper provider setup and mock services.
    
    // This is a placeholder test - update with actual app tests
    expect(1 + 1, equals(2));
