### The Story Behind CaptainVFR

CaptainVFR started as a simple idea: what if every VFR pilot had access to the same quality of flight planning tools as commercial operators? 

Founded by a group of passionate aviators who experienced firsthand the challenges of VFR flight planning, we set out to create a solution that would be:

- **Comprehensive**: All the tools needed for safe VFR flight operations
- **Accessible**: Available on any device, anywhere, anytime
- **Free**: No barriers to entry for safety-critical tools
- **User-friendly**: Intuitive enough for students, powerful enough for professionals

Today, CaptainVFR serves thousands of pilots across the globe, from student pilots planning their first cross-country flights to experienced aviators exploring new horizons.
