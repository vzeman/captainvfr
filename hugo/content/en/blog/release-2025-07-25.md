We're pleased to announce an update that simplifies the Captain VFR experience by enhancing our offline capabilities and removing the need for user-provided API keys.

## üåê Simplified OpenAIP Integration

### No More API Key Configuration
Based on user feedback and our commitment to making Captain VFR as accessible as possible, we've removed the requirement for users to configure their own OpenAIP API key. All airspace and reporting point data is now pre-downloaded and bundled with the application, ensuring:

- **Immediate access**: No setup required - airspace data is available right from the first launch
- **Consistent performance**: No API rate limits or network delays when loading airspace information
- **True offline capability**: All aviation data works without any internet connection
- **Simplified user experience**: One less configuration step for new users

### How It Works
Our build process now automatically downloads and processes all OpenAIP data before each release, converting it into an optimized format that's included with the app. This means:
- Airspace boundaries are available instantly
- Reporting points load without network calls
- No API keys to manage or expire
- Reduced app complexity and potential points of failure

## üöÄ Performance Benefits

By pre-processing all OpenAIP data, we've achieved:
- **Faster map loading**: Airspace data loads from local storage instead of network calls
- **Improved reliability**: No dependency on external API availability
- **Better offline experience**: All features work seamlessly without internet

## üì± What This Means for You

- **New users**: Simply download and start using Captain VFR - no API keys needed
- **Existing users**: Your stored OpenAIP API keys are no longer used and can be removed
- **All users**: Enjoy faster, more reliable access to airspace and reporting point data

## Looking Forward

This change is part of our ongoing effort to make Captain VFR the most user-friendly and reliable VFR flight planning tool available. By reducing external dependencies and improving offline capabilities, we're ensuring that pilots can always access the tools they need, regardless of internet connectivity.

Thank you for your continued support and feedback. Safe flying!
