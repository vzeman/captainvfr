# Introducing the CaptainVFR Digital Pilot Logbook

We're thrilled to announce a major new feature in CaptainVFR: a comprehensive **Digital Pilot Logbook** that seamlessly integrates with our flight tracking capabilities. This powerful addition transforms how pilots maintain their flight records, making logbook management more efficient and accurate than ever before.

## Why We Built This

Every pilot knows the importance of maintaining an accurate logbook. It's not just a regulatory requirementâ€”it's a record of your aviation journey, your progress, and your achievements. However, traditional paper logbooks can be cumbersome, and transferring data from flight tracking apps to logbook entries has always been a manual, error-prone process.

We designed the CaptainVFR Digital Logbook to solve these challenges by creating a seamless workflow from flight tracking to official logbook entry.

## Key Features

### Automatic Flight Import
The standout feature is our one-click import from recorded flights. When you complete a flight with CaptainVFR's tracking enabled, all the essential data is automatically captured:
- Departure and arrival airports (detected within 5km radius)
- Block time and flight time
- Route information
- GPS track for reference

Simply click the prominent "Add to Logbook" button in any flight detail screen, and watch as your logbook entry is pre-populated with accurate data.

### Comprehensive Entry Management
Our digital logbook supports all standard pilot logbook fields:
- **Time Categories**: PIC, SIC, Dual, Solo, Cross-Country
- **Conditions**: Day, Night, Actual/Simulated Instrument
- **Operations**: Landings, Approaches, Holds
- **Aircraft Information**: Registration, Type, Category
- **Remarks**: For training notes and observations

### Smart Features
- **Automatic Calculations**: Duration, day/night determination, cross-country detection
- **Data Validation**: Ensures time consistency and completeness
- **Quick Entry**: Recent aircraft list, airport auto-complete
- **Template Support**: Save common flights for quick entry

### Professional Export Options
Your logbook data is always yours. Export in multiple formats:
- **PDF Pages**: Traditional logbook format for printing
- **CSV Files**: For spreadsheet analysis and backup
- **Digital Formats**: Compatible with other e-logbook applications

3. **Add to Logbook**: Click the "Add to Logbook" button
