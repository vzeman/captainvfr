## Understanding METAR Reports

METAR (Meteorological Aerodrome Report) is the international standard for formatting and transmitting weather observations. These reports provide pilots with crucial real-time weather information needed for flight planning and decision-making. Updated regularly, METARs form the foundation of aviation weather services.

## METAR Format and Structure

### Basic Format

A typical METAR follows this structure:
```
METAR ICAO TIME AUTO/COR WIND VIS RVR WX CLOUDS TEMP/DEW ALTIMETER RMK
```

### Example METAR
```
METAR KJFK 121751Z 24016G28KT 3SM -RA BR BKN012 OVC025 18/16 A2978 RMK AO2
```

## Decoding METAR Elements

### Report Type and Location
- **METAR**: Routine weather report
- **SPECI**: Special report for significant changes
- **ICAO Code**: Four-letter airport identifier (e.g., KJFK for JFK International)

### Time
- **Format**: DDHHmmZ
- **DD**: Day of the month
- **HHmm**: Time in UTC (Zulu)
- **Z**: Zulu time indicator

### Wind Information
- **Direction**: Three digits (true heading)
- **Speed**: Two or three digits
- **Units**: KT (knots), MPS (meters per second), or KMH
- **Gusts**: G followed by speed
- **Variable**: VRB for variable direction
- **Calm**: 00000KT

Example: 24016G28KT = Wind from 240° at 16 knots, gusting to 28 knots

### Visibility
- **Statute Miles**: Used in US (e.g., 3SM)
- **Meters**: Used internationally (e.g., 9999)
- **Fractions**: 1/2SM, 1/4SM
- **Variable**: May include directional variations

### Runway Visual Range (RVR)
- **Format**: R(runway)/(visibility)FT
- **Trends**: U (up), D (down), N (no change)
- **Variable**: V between two values
Example: R04L/2200FT

### Weather Phenomena

**Intensity**
- **-** Light
- **(no sign)** Moderate
- **+** Heavy
- **VC** In vicinity

**Descriptors**
- **MI**: Shallow
- **BC**: Patches
- **DR**: Drifting
- **BL**: Blowing
- **SH**: Showers
- **TS**: Thunderstorm
- **FZ**: Freezing
- **PR**: Partial

**Precipitation**
- **RA**: Rain
- **SN**: Snow
- **GR**: Hail
- **GS**: Small hail
- **PL**: Ice pellets
- **DZ**: Drizzle
- **IC**: Ice crystals
- **UP**: Unknown precipitation

**Obscuration**
- **BR**: Mist
- **FG**: Fog
- **HZ**: Haze
- **FU**: Smoke
- **VA**: Volcanic ash
- **DU**: Dust
- **SA**: Sand
- **PY**: Spray

### Cloud Coverage
- **SKC/CLR**: Sky clear
- **FEW**: 1-2 oktas (1/8-2/8 coverage)
- **SCT**: 3-4 oktas (3/8-4/8 coverage)
- **BKN**: 5-7 oktas (5/8-7/8 coverage)
- **OVC**: 8 oktas (full coverage)
- **VV**: Vertical visibility (indefinite ceiling)

Heights in hundreds of feet AGL
Example: BKN012 = Broken clouds at 1,200 feet

### Temperature and Dewpoint
- **Format**: TT/DD
- **M**: Minus (below zero)
Example: 18/16 = Temperature 18°C, Dewpoint 16°C

### Altimeter Setting
- **A**: Inches of mercury (US)
- **Q**: Hectopascals/millibars (International)
Example: A2978 = 29.78 inches Hg

## Special Sections

### Remarks (RMK)
Common remarks include:
- **AO1/AO2**: Type of automated station
- **PK WND**: Peak wind
- **WSHFT**: Wind shift
- **SLP**: Sea level pressure
- **T**: Precise temperature/dewpoint
- **P**: Precipitation amount
- **$**: Maintenance indicator

### Trend Forecast
Some countries append trend forecasts:
- **NOSIG**: No significant change
- **BECMG**: Becoming
- **TEMPO**: Temporary

## AUTO vs Manual Reports

### AUTO Reports
- Generated by automated weather stations
- May miss certain phenomena
- Generally reliable for basic parameters
- Indicated by "AUTO" in report

### Manual Reports
- Human observer supplements automated data
- Can report more complex phenomena
- More accurate cloud type identification
- No "AUTO" designation

## Common METAR Scenarios

### VFR Conditions
```
METAR KORD 151856Z 09014KT 10SM FEW250 23/14 A3012
```
Clear skies, excellent visibility

### Marginal VFR
```
METAR KBOS 151856Z 36012KT 4SM BR OVC008 16/15 A2992
```
Low ceiling, reduced visibility

### IFR Conditions
```
METAR KSEA 151856Z 24008KT 1/2SM FG VV002 12/12 A3015
```
Very low visibility, indefinite ceiling

### Severe Weather
```
METAR KDFW 151856Z 32025G45KT 1SM +TSRA SQ BKN008 OVC020CB 22/18 A2952
```
Thunderstorm with heavy rain and squalls

## Using METAR for Flight Planning

### Pre-flight Considerations
1. Check multiple METARs along route
2. Note trends over several hours
3. Compare with TAF forecasts
4. Consider alternate airports
5. Evaluate personal minimums

### In-flight Updates
- Monitor destination METAR changes
- Check alternates if weather deteriorating
- Use ATIS/AWOS for latest information
- Request updates from ATC/FSS

## International Variations

### Regional Differences
- Visibility units (SM vs meters)
- Pressure units (inches vs hectopascals)
- Temperature in remarks (US includes tenths)
- Additional national codes

### Color Codes (Military/Some Civilian)
- **BLUE**: VFR (ceiling >2500, vis >5)
- **WHITE**: VFR (ceiling 1500-2500, vis 3-5)
- **GREEN**: MVFR (ceiling 500-1500, vis 1-3)
- **YELLOW**: IFR (ceiling 200-500, vis 0.5-1)
- **RED**: LIFR (ceiling <200, vis <0.5)

## Common Errors in Reading METARs

1. Confusing cloud heights (AGL vs MSL)
2. Misinterpreting visibility units
3. Missing trend indicators
4. Overlooking remarks section
5. Not considering report age

## Digital METAR Sources

Modern pilots access METARs through:
- Aviation weather websites
- Mobile apps like CaptainVFR
- Flight planning software
- ATC/FSS briefings
- ATIS/AWOS broadcasts

METARs remain the cornerstone of aviation weather reporting, providing standardized, timely information essential for safe flight operations. Understanding how to read and interpret these reports is fundamental to every pilot's weather assessment skills.
