6. **Enhanced spatial index deduplication for all data types** - ✓ DONE
   - Made deduplication a global feature of the spatial index system
   - Added uniqueId getter to SpatialIndexable interface
   - Updated all spatially indexed models (Airport, Navaid, ReportingPoint, Obstacle, Hotspot) to implement SpatialIndexable
   - Added ID tracking Sets to both SpatialIndex and GridSpatialIndex classes
   - Modified insert methods to check for duplicate IDs using the generic uniqueId property
   - Prevents any spatially indexed item from being added multiple times across tile loads
   - Ensures unique items in search results even when tiles overlap for all data types

7. **Fixed MissingPluginException for network diagnostics** - ✓ DONE
   - Added proper exception handling for MissingPluginException in getNetworkDiagnostics
   - Method channel calls now fail gracefully when platform implementation is missing

   - Removed scripts/monitor_build.dart - associated script not in active use
   - Keeping codebase clean per CLAUDE.md guidelines

12. **Consolidated build scripts** - ✓ DONE
   - Removed build_web.sh as its functionality is already in build_release.sh
   - build_release.sh now builds all platforms: Android (APK & AAB), iOS, macOS, and Web
   - Single script for all release builds improves maintainability

2. **Unified marker sizing across all types** - ✓ DONE
   - All navigation markers now use consistent sizing:
     - 20px at zoom >= 12, 14px otherwise (navaids, reporting points, obstacles, hotspots)
     - Font size: 11px at zoom >= 12, 9px otherwise
   - Removed smooth interpolation in favor of simple zoom-based sizing

### Code Quality Improvements (2025-07-23)

### Runway Visualization Implementation (2025-07-23)
1. **Implemented runway visualization on airport markers** - ✓ DONE
   - Created RunwayPainter to draw runway lines at correct angles
   - Added SimpleRunwayPainter to handle OpenAIP runway format
   - Shows runway visualization at zoom level 13 and above
   - Runway lines drawn based on designator (e.g., 04 = 40°)
   - Note: Currently limited by data availability - OpenAIP airports don't include runway data
   - Future improvement: Load and merge OurAirports runway data with airport markers
