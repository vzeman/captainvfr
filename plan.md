# Development tasks for the project

- [x] airports of type 'BALOONPORT' should have different marker - it should be a balloon 
- [x]  ballonports should be toggled on the map together with the heliports and not with airports in the right panel with toggle buttons

## Performance improvements
- [x] analyze the code for performance issues - rendering, data loading, during drag and drop is the map very slow

## Bugs
- [x] airspaces doesnt have correct altitudes, they show for all airspaces GND - UNL ... this is incorrect ... in the bundled data I can see the data are correct
